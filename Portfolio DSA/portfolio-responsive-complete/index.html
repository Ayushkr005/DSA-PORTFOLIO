                    <p class="work__description">
                        In this unit, I began with a comprehensive overview of programming fundamentals using C.
                        I explored primitive data types and their manipulation through structures, including
                        self-referential structures which are key to advanced data structure implementations.
                        By understanding pointers and dynamic memory allocation, I laid a foundation for memory
                        management in programming.
                        Additionally, matrix multiplication techniques were covered to handle computational problems.
                        I was introduced to the concept of Data Structures, including Abstract Data Types (ADTs), their
                        types, and operations.
                        Mathematical notations like Big O, Omega, and Theta were thoroughly examined to evaluate
                        algorithm performance.
                        This unit emphasized the importance of understanding time and space complexity and making
                        trade-offs when optimizing algorithms for efficiency.

                    <p class="work__description">
                        This unit provided a deep dive into List ADT operations such as creating, inserting, searching,
                        deleting, and displaying elements.
                        I learned how lists are implemented using arrays, cursor-based methods, and linked lists. The
                        exploration of different types of linked lists—singly, doubly, and circular—helped in
                        understanding memory efficiency and access time improvements.
                        Real-world applications of lists, such as handling Sparse Matrices and performing Polynomial
                        Arithmetic, showcased the importance of List ADTs.
                        Additionally, the Josephus Problem, which involves cyclically eliminating elements, was a
                        fascinating challenge that illustrated the application of circular lists.

                    <p class="work__description">
                        In this unit, I mastered the Stack ADT, focusing on its key operations such as push, pop, and
                        top.
                        Stacks were implemented using both arrays and linked lists to understand different memory
                        utilization techniques.
                        I learned various applications of stacks, including converting infix expressions to postfix,
                        evaluating postfix expressions, and solving common problems like balancing symbols and managing
                        function calls.
                        The Tower of Hanoi problem was particularly intriguing, demonstrating recursion and stack
                        management.
                        Queues were studied next, focusing on their operations: enqueue and dequeue. I implemented
                        queues using arrays and linked lists and explored advanced types like circular queues,
                        double-ended queues, and priority queues, understanding their use cases in scheduling
                        algorithms, which are vital for efficient task management in operating systems.

                    <p class="work__description">
                        This unit provided an in-depth understanding of tree data structures. Starting with basic binary
                        trees, I learned about tree traversal methods such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order, and
                        their applications in various algorithms.
                        The concept of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) was introduced to efficiently search and manage
                        ordered data.
                        AVL trees and B-trees were covered to understand the importance of balanced trees in optimizing
                        search operations.
                        Heaps were also introduced, and their applications in priority queues and heapsort were
                        discussed.
                        On the hashing front, I learned about the importance of hash functions for data retrieval and
                        the methods used to avoid collisions, such as separate chaining and open addressing, along with
                        probing techniques like linear and quadratic probing. These techniques ensure efficient storage
                        and quick access to data.

                    <p class="work__description">
                        In the final unit, I explored the intricate world of graph theory.
                        Starting with the basics of graphs, I delved into different traversal methods like Depth-First
                        Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), which are critical for navigating through graph
                        data structures.
                        I then learned about topological sorting, which is essential for tasks that require dependency
                        management.
                        The minimum spanning tree (MST) problem was tackled using Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms, both
                        crucial for optimizing network connections.
                        The study of shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm helped me understand how to find
                        the shortest distance between nodes in weighted graphs, a fundamental concept in fields such as
                        network routing and geographic mapping.

                I am particularly fond of trees because they provide an efficient way to organize and access data hierarchically. 
                The concept of Binary Search Trees and AVL trees fascinated me due to their balance and search efficiency, which can significantly improve performance in various applications. 
                Learning tree traversal methods allowed me to understand how algorithms can efficiently navigate complex data structures.

            <p class="projects__description">
                The stack and queue structures are fundamental to understanding how data is organized and accessed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) and first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, respectively. 
                I appreciate their simplicity and utility in solving a variety of problems, such as expression evaluation and task scheduling.
